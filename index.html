# Welcome to my First blog

I'm glad you are here. I just don't know that I can able to create my simple blog pages using git and github. Just in time for I am also studying git for my personal improvement in my programming career, since nowadays skill in Git is one of the skill developer must have.

*I am realy* **Excited!!** to share my thoughts about programming and other IT related stuffs that I gained for many years. I know these will be useful especially if you are like me starting your journey to be a **Self Taught Programmer.**

See you later.
