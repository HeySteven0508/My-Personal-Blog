# Why I chose to be a Self taught programmer?


I am a Computer Science Student and decided to stop my school because of two reasons: I just felt that I am wasting my **Money** and **Time**.
Yep, you heard it right. School slows my progress and I am paying more money in getting less knowledge in which that knowledge can't able to landed a job. 
In my opinion its better to invest your money to these paid programming course tutorials available online than paying it in university because you will learn a lot 
and able to build a real-world applications. We also have the internet, we have access to vast resources of the technology we want to learn, libraries, articles, blogs, documentation and more. It is just like your library at school but this is free. Online courses (free or paid) and Online references (documentation,blogs) are the only needed to gain skills and landed a programming career jobs.

### Is Self-teaching is better than School? ###

First of all I am not *Anti-Education*, in fact I value education very much. I spent countless hours of reading, studying and exploring in my own time because I believe that education is key to success. I am just not relying on school in terms of learning programming because sometimes the contents are obsolete or incomplete. We can't blame them because technology evolves rapidly and our school system not. In order for us not to left behind we take an extra mile by researching on our own and start to build it. By doing that we are already a self-taught programmer.
