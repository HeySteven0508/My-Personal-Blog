# Why I chose to be a Self taught programmer?


I am a Computer Science Student and decided to stop my school because of two reasons: I just felt that I am wasting my **Money** and **Time**.
Yep, you heard it right. School slows my progress and I am paying more money in getting less knowledge in which that knowledge can't able to landed a job. 
In my opinion its better to invest your money to these paid programming course tutorials available online than paying it in university because you will learn a lot 
and able to build a real-world applications. We also have the internet, we have access to vast resources of the technology we want to learn, libraries, articles, blogs, documentation and more. It is just like your library at school but this is free.
